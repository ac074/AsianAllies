      <h2>Face the Facts</h2>
      <p>
        Asian hate crimes have surged following events like 9/11 and the COVID-19 pandemic, fueling hatred and alienation towards the Asian community and creating a hostile environment for many. Despite increased discrimination and violence, Asians are the least likely to report such hate crimes. This reluctance often stems from a fear of drawing unwanted attention or feeling like a burden to their families, especially for first-generation individuals with immigrant parents. However, they are not alone; many people in the Asian community are experiencing the same challenges. Click the button below to understand the full scope of this problem.
